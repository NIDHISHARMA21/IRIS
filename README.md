## Iris Flower Species Classification ##

# Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris dataset, containing measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, is used to train and evaluate classification models. The goal is to accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

# Features

1. Data Exploration: Analyze the Iris dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA), including pair plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
2. Model Training: Train Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers to predict Iris species.
3. Model Optimization: Optimize the SVM model using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance with accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
4. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA to visualize the dataset in 2D space.
5. Deployment: Deploy the SVM model with a Streamlit web application for user-friendly predictions.
