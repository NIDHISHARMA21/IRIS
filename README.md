## Iris Flower Species Classification ##

# Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris dataset, containing measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, is used to train and evaluate classification models. The goal is to accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
